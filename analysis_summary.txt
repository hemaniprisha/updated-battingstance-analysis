RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------

Pitching Strategy:
  • Target Cluster 3 stances (foot sep: 39.3, angle: -6.1°) - 29.3% success rate
  • Avoid attacking Cluster 1 stances directly - only 24.8% pitcher success rate
  • Use ST vs Cluster 0 - -11.5% effectiveness
  • Use FF vs Cluster 1 - -26.9% effectiveness
  • Use SL vs Cluster 2 - -17.6% effectiveness
  • Use CU vs Cluster 3 - 7.1% effectiveness
  • Use KC vs Cluster 4 - -12.7% effectiveness

Hitting Adjustments:
  • Players with narrow stances should consider widening (avg foot sep < 27)
  • Extremely closed stances (< -20°) may benefit from slight opening
  • Wide stances (> 35 foot separation) show good overall performance

Coaching Insights:
  • Stance clustering reveals 5 distinct batting approaches
  • Best performing stance: 39.3 foot separation, -6.1° angle
  • Success rate variance across stances: 0.019 (higher = more differentiation)
